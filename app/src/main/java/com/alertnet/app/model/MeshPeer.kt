 * Represents a peer device discovered on the mesh network.

 * are considered inactive.
 *
 * @property deviceId Unique per-install UUID of the peer
 * @property displayName Human-readable name (device model or user-set name)
 * @property lastSeen Epoch millis when this peer was last detected
 * @property rssi BLE signal strength (null if discovered via WiFi Direct only)
 * @property transportType How this peer is currently reachable
 * @property ipAddress WiFi Direct IP address (null if BLE only)
 * @property macAddress BLE MAC address (null if WiFi Direct only)
 * @property discoveryType How this peer was initially discovered (BLE or WIFI_DIRECT)
 * @property isConnected Whether an active transport connection exists
